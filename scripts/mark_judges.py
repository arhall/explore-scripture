"""Mark judges in the genealogy CSV data.

This script updates the judge column to 'true' for individuals who served
as judges of Israel according to the Book of Judges and 1 Samuel.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/mark_judges.py

The script marks judges from three categories:
1. Judges proper (Book of Judges): Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Deborah, Barak,
   Gideon/Jerubbaal, Abimelech, Tola, Jair, Jephthah, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon, Samson
2. Transitional leaders (1 Samuel): Eli (priest/judge), Samuel (prophet/judge)
3. Textual variants: Bedan (1 Sam 12:11, possibly Barak or Jair)

The judges marked depend on which individuals exist in the CSV dataset.
Currently marks 17 individuals present in the data.

After running this script, update the judges cluster and regenerate data:
    # Script updates clusters-latest/index.json with judge IDs
    python3 scripts/generate_bible_tree.py
    npm run build
